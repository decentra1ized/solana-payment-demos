# Solana Payment Showcase

> Interactive demo website showcasing Solana-based payment solutions for enterprise partners. Built by Chaerin Kim @ Solana Foundation.

## Overview

This is an educational and demonstration platform for Solana blockchain payment capabilities. It provides hands-on demos running on Solana Devnet (testnet) with real verifiable transactions.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Payment Demos**: Real Solana Devnet transactions users can execute
- **Stablecoin Metrics**: Data visualizations from Visa Onchain Analytics and Dune Analytics
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Korean
- **Test Wallet System**: Browser-based wallet generation for demo purposes

## Payment Demo Use Cases

### 1. Solana Pay QR
Point-of-sale QR code payment flow using Solana Pay protocol.
- Merchant generates payment request QR
- Customer scans and confirms payment
- Real-time transaction confirmation

### 2. Basic SOL Payment
Simple peer-to-peer SOL transfer demonstration.
- Device-to-device transfer visualization
- Transaction signing and confirmation flow

### 3. Payment with Memo
SOL transfer with on-chain memo attachment.
- Useful for order IDs, reference numbers
- Uses SPL Memo Program

### 4. Batch Payment
Multiple recipients in a single atomic transaction.
- Cost efficiency (one fee vs multiple)
- Atomicity guarantee (all-or-nothing)

### 5. Fee Abstraction
Third-party fee sponsorship demonstration.
- Institution pays transaction fees
- Enables gasless UX for end users

## Technical Specifications (Accurate as of 2025)

### Solana Network Parameters

- **Base Transaction Fee**: 5,000 lamports per signature
  - USD value varies with SOL price
  - Priority fees may apply during congestion

- **Block/Slot Time**: ~400ms
  - This is NOT finality time
  - Finalized confirmation: ~12-13 seconds (32 slots after confirmed)
  - Alpenglow upgrade planned: ~120ms slot time (0.1-0.15s)

- **Throughput (TPS)**:
  - In practice: 1,000+ TPS (varies by measurement method)
  - Theoretical maximum: 65,000+ TPS (ideal conditions)
  - Note: TPS metrics vary based on vote transaction inclusion

### Important Clarifications

1. **400ms is slot time, not finality**: Solana's ~400ms refers to block production time. Full finalization requires ~32 additional slots (~12-13 seconds).

2. **Transaction costs are variable**: The base fee is fixed in lamports, but USD equivalent changes with SOL price. Priority fees add to costs during network congestion.

3. **TPS measurements vary**: Different sources report different TPS due to inclusion/exclusion of vote transactions and measurement methodology.

## Data Sources

- **Stablecoin Metrics**: Visa Onchain Analytics (https://visaonchainanalytics.com/)
- **Median Fee Data**: Dune Analytics (https://dune.com/queries/5943670/9593199)
  - Median fee is more representative than average/mean because it's unaffected by outlier transactions
- **Network Specs**: Solana Documentation (https://solana.com/docs)

## Technology Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- @solana/web3.js for blockchain interactions
- Recharts for data visualization
- Framer Motion for animations

## Network

All demos operate on **Solana Devnet** (testnet). No real value is transferred. Test SOL has no monetary value.
